## Business Rules :pushpin:
- CRUD operations for Customer/Loan.
- If the credit score is below 500 points, the loan application of the customer is rejected. (Credit result: REJECTION)
- If the credit score is between 500 points and 1000 points and the monthly income is below 5000 TL, the loan application of the customer is approved. A limit of 10,000 TL is assigned to the customer. (Credit result: APPROVAL)
- If the credit score is between 500 points and 1000 points and the monthly income is above 5000 TL, the loan application of the customer is approved. A limit of 20,000 TL is assigned to the customer. (Credit result: APPROVAL)
- If the credit score is 1000 points or more the loan application of the customer is approved. A limit equal to the monthly income x credit limit multiplier is assigned to the customer. (Credit result: APPROVAL)
- The credit limit multiplier is 4 by default.
- A completed loan application is only queried with an identification number.
